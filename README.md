# SQL database project
The project was done as a pre-examination requirement in the second year of studies.
The project represents the Microsoft SQL Server Database.

The database is intended for the faculty management system.

As part of the project, I also created functions, triggers and stored procedures
The database satisfies the first 3 normal forms, the eighth in cases where it was inappropriate to violate them in order to increase the performance of the system.

I am on this project:
- Improved knowledge in the field of functions, triggers and stored procedures.
- Learned how to design a database.
- Learned how to predict further possible directions of database development and to create a model accordingly.
- Learned how to find a balance between performance and satisfying normal forms.
